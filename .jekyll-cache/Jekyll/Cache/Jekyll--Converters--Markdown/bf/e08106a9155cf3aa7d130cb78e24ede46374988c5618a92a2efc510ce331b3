<p>Thank you for visiting this site. As many of you already know, my GitHub repos  https://github.com/K3TZR, host three Mac-native, open-source projects for Amateur Radio. They are:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. xLib6000 - a Mac-native version of FlexLib (TM)
2. xSDR6000 - a Mac-native version of SmartSDR (TM)
3. xAPITester - a Mac-native tool for interacting with the Flex API
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I would point out that xLib6000 and xSDR6000, while providing similar functionality to the Flex Radio equivalents, are not exact replacements. My intent has been to stay similar to the (excellent) Flex software to allow WIndows users to make an easy transition to the Mac. At the same time, the differences between the two platforms have mandated certain changes. I also haven’t hesitated to make “improvements” from time to time.</p>

<p>I plan to use this site to comment on various aspects of the software and/or the development process. I hope that the information provided will be useful and that you will feel free to comment on it.</p>

<p>The “Current release” of xSDR6000 and xAPITester each contain both the source code and a compiled executable. In the event that a release causes some new problem, you can revert to the previous release(s) also availble on GitHub.</p>

<p>The README.md file in each release contains a section titled “vn.n.n Release Notes”. I encourage you to read those notes to better understand what has changed in the new release.</p>

<p>At least for the present, the apps are NOT sandboxed. There is a Log Viewer choice in the xSDR6000 menu in the app as well as a stand alone xLogViewer app (on GitHub). Logs for xSDR6000 are located in:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"~/Library/Application Support/net.k3tzr.xSDR6000/Logs"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I started this project (years ago) hoping that by making a Mac-native version of FlexLib (TM) that others would use it to create other Mac software for use with Flex radios. So far two hams have done that; Mario (DL3LSM, author of xDAX, xCAT and xKey, https://dl3lsm.blogspot.com) and Pete (W6OP, author of xVoiceKeyer and xCW, https://w6op.com). Please give their apps a try.</p>

<p>I welcome your feedback on the software, good or bad, and any suggestions you may have for improving it. Please send all your comments to:</p>
